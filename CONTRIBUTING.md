# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please feel free to put up a PR for any issue or feature request. 
Even if you have little to no experience with Angular 2, I'll be more than happy to help. :)

## Setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Make a branch for your feature or bug fix
4. If you don't have Angular CLI installed: `npm install -g angular-cli@latest`
5. `ng init`
6. Input `n` for each file to not overwrite any file changes
7. Run `npm build` to check if a build works (if this doesn't work, please file an issue with your error message)
8. Run `npm serve` and open `localhost:4200` in a browser
9. Work your magic
10. Run `ng build --prod` or `ng serve --prod` to kick off a production build and make sure nothing is broken
11. Commit your changes and reference the issue you're addressing (for example: `git commit -am 'Commit message. Closes #5'`)
12. Push your branch to your fork
13. Create a pull request from your branch on your fork to `master` on this repo
14. Have your branch get merged in! :star2:
