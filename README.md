## Offline Support

This app uses a Service Worker to load quickly and work offline.

* [`sw-precache`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache) is used to serve local static resources (App Shell) cache first.
* [`sw-toolbox`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-toolbox) is used to handle requests using the `networkFirst` strategy. If a request fails, the app will fulfill the request from the cache. This means previously loaded pages will now work offline.

## Manifest

With Chromium based browsers for Android (Chrome, Opera, etc...), Angular 2 HN includes a Web App Manifest that allows you to install to your homescreen.

## Themes

Built in theme engine!

Current themes:
* Default
* Night
* Black (AMOLED)

More to come!

## Areas of improvement

 - Realtime updating using the Firebase SDK (may need to add option to settings so service worker can still rely on REST endpoints)
 - Server side rendering

Feel free to send me feedback on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh) or [file an issue](https://github.com/hdjirdeh/angular2-hn/issues/new)! Feature requests are always welcome.

## Build process

Note: This project has been ejected (with AOT + production settings) in order to customize Webpack configurations.

 - Clone or download the repo
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` to run the application with webpack-dev-server or `npm build` to kick off a fresh build and update the output directory (`dist/`)

Note: Any Service Worker changes will not be reflected when you run the application locally in development. To test service worker changes:
 - `npm build`
 - `npm run precache` to generate the service worker file
 - `npm run static-serve` to load the application along with the service worker asset using [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server)
